Maria Bartnik - 3rd AR lab

During our third AR development lab, we focused on implementing a 3D representation of a planet alongside UI information when the user taps a planet in the AR solar-system scene. Our initial idea was to embed a 3D object directly inside Unity’s built-in UI system. However, Unity’s UI rendering system is not designed to directly host 3D objects, this approach quickly became hard to achieve. 

To simulate a 3D object appearing as part of the UI, we placed all the planet models as children of the AR Camera. Each planet object was positioned slightly to the left of the user’s view so that, when enabled, it appears beside the UI panel. At the start of the application, every one of these "UI planets" is disabled. When the user taps a planet in the AR scene, only the corresponding one is activated and moves into view. 

UIManager is an empty object that controls the GUI Unity embedded features in our project. It has a script called Object Info UI.cs that controls which of the planet info’s is displayed in UI Canvas. It takes serialised fields of the text meshes of the UI canvas, and fills it in according to which planet’s name it is passed in ShowInfo() method.

To control this behavior, we implemented a PressOnPlanet script that extends the PressInputBase script. This script contains serialized references to all the “UI versions” of the planets, the literal 3D objects, as well as a variable to keep track of which planet is currently active. Using AR raycasting that tracks the touch on the phone’s screen, the script detects which object in the AR environment the user tapped. If the hit object’s name matches one of the keys in our planet-UI mapping dictionary, the script notifies the UI manager which planet was selected and enables the appropriate 3D object. Before activating a new one, it disables the previously active planet so that the UI always displays a single, clear model. 
This script was added to a central Manager object that handles input and interaction events. By combining this with a dedicated UI Manager, we were able to coordinate the 3D “UI planet” model with Unity’s traditional GUI elements. 

We also took advantage of this setup to add planet animations. Because the UI planets were simply regular 3D objects attached to the camera, we could reuse the rotational scripts from the solar system itself, the Planet Orbit script, just without them orbiting around the centre of the Solar's system. This allowed each planet to slowly spin in place as a part of UI, allowing the user to take a closer look at each planet. 
To improve usability, we added a button that hides the UI and the active planet model, allowing users to return to exploring the full solar system without any visual obstruction. 
On the very end of the project work, we added a “sound of space” to immerse the user even more in their cosmical exploration. 

With these final touches, we brought the AR solar system project to completion. Throughout the process, we learned how to blend 3D models with UI elements, manage AR interactions through raycasting, and build a clean, responsive interface that enhances the user’s exploration experience. The final result is an interactive and polished AR application that allows users to tap planets, view them up close, read detailed information, and enjoy an immersive cosmic environment.
