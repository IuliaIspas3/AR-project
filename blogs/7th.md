In this third lab session of our VR waste-sorting experience, we continued refining the project as our environment and basic interactions were already in place. The backyard of the restaurant was fully designed, featuring messy tables, scattered leftovers, and different types of trash that players could grab and throw using VR controllers. With the world and interaction system functioning well, we shifted our focus toward turning the prototype into a real, engaging game through scoring, feedback, and better content variety.
The main objective of this session was to implement a scoring system that rewards the user not just for sorting waste correctly, but also for how skillfully they perform the task. To display this score in a natural and immersive way, we decided to use a World Space Canvas mounted like a physical scoreboard on one of the backyard walls. We wanted to avoid using a screen-locked UI, because constantly having a score panel stuck in the user's view would quickly become annoying in VR. Instead, placing it in the environment makes it feel like a real sign the restaurant staff might use, giving feedback without breaking immersion.
We then worked on the scoring logic itself. The rules we implemented were:
Correct sorting gives points
When the user throws an item into the correct bin category, their score increases. But instead of simply adding a fixed number of points, we shaped the scoring to encourage more dynamic gameplay.
The formula we used is:
Score gained = (throw distance + 5)
This means the farther the user stands when making a successful throw, the more points they receive. The additional constant bonus of 5 ensures the player always earns a meaningful reward, even for short throws. This approach makes the experience more exciting, motivating users to move around the environment rather than standing still next to a bin.
Incorrect sorting subtracts points
If the user throws an item into the wrong bin category, we subtract one point. This small penalty encourages accuracy while still keeping the experience playful and forgiving.
To make scoring more intuitive and to provide quick feedback, we added a second UI element: a feedback World Space Canvas placed as a child of the MainCamera inside the XR Origin (XR Rig). This canvas appears briefly in front of the user every time points are gained or lost, showing messages such as “+8 points!” or “-1 wrong bin.” Because it is attached to the camera, it pops up in the user’s view only when needed, then disappears. This gives immediate feedback without cluttering the environment or becoming a permanent distraction.
With the scoring and feedback systems in place, we also expanded the interactions by adding more trash objects. Up until now, we had only a few sample items, mainly used for testing. This session, we added two to three objects per trash category, ensuring each bin had multiple appropriate items: glass bottles for the glass bin, cans for metal, food containers, paper items, and so on. This made the gameplay feel more complete and allowed us to test the scoring rules thoroughly across many object types. 
Once all objects were added, we tested the scoring thoroughly: throwing items from different distances, intentionally making mistakes, and verifying that the feedback canvas appeared correctly each time. Seeing points pop up dynamically made the experience feel much more polished and game-like. It also helped us quickly identify edge cases and fine-tune distances and thresholds.
By the end of the session, we had transformed our basic interaction prototype into a more interactive and rewarding experience. The addition of the scoreboard, the real-time feedback system, and the distance-based scoring brought a sense of progression and purpose. The player now moves around the backyard, considers the best angle or distance to take, sorts trash more mindfully, and sees both immediate and cumulative feedback.
Although future improvements could include sound effects, better animations, or possibly a timer or challenge mode, this session marked an essential step forward. Our VR project now feels more like a playable game, with clear rules, satisfying feedback, and an environment that supports and enhances the overall experience.
